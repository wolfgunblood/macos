## Short Description
This project is a macOS clone built using React and TypeScript. It aims to recreate the familiar and intuitive user interface of macOS within a web application. The combination of React's component-based architecture, TypeScript's type safety, and the sleek design of macOS provides a seamless and responsive user experience. Users will be able to interact with a macOS-like interface, including windows, menus, and toolbars, offering cross-platform compatibility and the convenience of a familiar operating system within their web browser.

## Motivation
The motivation behind building a macOS-like interface in React and TypeScript is to provide a familiar and intuitive user experience for web applications. macOS has been widely acclaimed for its sleek design, usability, and productivity-enhancing features. By recreating a similar interface using React and TypeScript, I aim to bring the power of macOS to the web.

## 🤝 Contributions
This project is open to contributions! I am still working on some features (Calculator, Calendar, VSCode, Music App) and there's probably a ton of things to add/change/fix. Feel free to fork it and create a PR!
